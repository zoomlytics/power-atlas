# Network Methods 101: Shared Mathematical Foundations

**Internal Technical Memo**

---

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This memo establishes a shared mathematical vocabulary and set of modeling conventions for network-based analysis within Power Atlas. It synthesizes canonical methodological foundations from Newman (2010), Barabási (2016), and Granovetter (1973), focusing strictly on mathematical representations, metrics, and algorithmic properties.

This document does **not** make sociological claims. All outputs of network analysis are treated as **computational artifacts** subject to uncertainty, parameter dependence, and model error.

## 2. Canonical Graph Vocabulary

### 2.1 Graph

A graph is an ordered pair:

\[
G = (V, E)
\]

- \( V \): set of nodes (vertices)  
- \( E \subseteq V \times V \): set of edges  

Edges may be:

- Undirected: \( (i,j) = (j,i) \)  
- Directed: \( (i,j) \neq (j,i) \)

---

### 2.2 Adjacency Matrix

\[
A_{ij} =
\begin{cases}
w_{ij} & \text{if edge from } i \text{ to } j \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

- Binary graphs: \( w_{ij} \in \{0,1\} \)  
- Weighted graphs: \( w_{ij} \in \mathbb{R}^+ \)

**Intuition:**  
Matrix encoding of connectivity.

**Implementation Implications**

- Dense matrix: \(O(n^2)\) storage  
- Sparse matrix: store only nonzero entries  

**Failure Modes**

- Dense storage infeasible for large \(n\)  
- Implicit assumption of static snapshot  

**Power Atlas Considerations**

- Store as sparse representations  
- Associate each matrix with:
  - Time window  
  - Edge type  
  - Provenance  

---

### 2.3 Edge List

\[
E = \{(i,j,w_{ij})\}
\]

**Intuition:**  
Record of observed relations.

**Implementation Implications**

- Append-friendly  
- Natural for event-based ingestion  

**Failure Modes**

- Harder to compute matrix operations directly  

**Power Atlas**

- Canonical storage format  
- Derived matrices are computed artifacts  

---

### 2.4 Directed vs Undirected

- Directed: citation, command, flow  
- Undirected: co-membership, co-attendance  

**Failure Mode**

- Treating symmetric relations as directional or vice versa  

---

### 2.5 Weighted vs Unweighted

Weights encode:

- Frequency  
- Duration  
- Intensity  
- Confidence  

**Failure Mode**

- Interpreting weights as comparable across edge types  

---

### 2.6 Bipartite Graph

\[
G = (P \cup I, E), \quad E \subseteq P \times I
\]

No edges within the same partition.

Adjacency:

\[
B_{pi} =
\begin{cases}
1 & p \text{ connected to } i \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

---

### 2.7 Projection

\[
A = B B^{T}
\]

Produces one-mode graph among \(P\).

**Failure Mode**

- Clique inflation  
- Density distortion  

---

### 2.8 Sparse vs Dense

Density:

\[
\rho = \frac{|E|}{|V|(|V|-1)}
\]

Most real-world networks are sparse.

---

## 3. Mathematical Foundations

### 3.1 Centrality Measures

#### Degree Centrality

\[
k_i = \sum_j A_{ij}
\]

**Intuition:** local activity  

**Does Not Measure**

- Brokerage  
- Influence  
- Control  

---

#### Betweenness Centrality

\[
C_B(i) = \sum_{s \neq i \neq t} \frac{\sigma_{st}(i)}{\sigma_{st}}
\]

where \( \sigma_{st} \) is number of shortest paths between \(s\) and \(t\).

**Intuition:** position on shortest paths  

**Computational Cost**

- \(O(nm)\) with Brandes algorithm  

**Instability**

- Small edge changes → large score shifts  

**Does Not Measure**

- Authority  
- Popularity  

---

#### Eigenvector Centrality

\[
x_i = \frac{1}{\lambda} \sum_j A_{ij} x_j
\]

Principal eigenvector of \(A\).

**Intuition:** connected to important nodes  

**Failure Modes**

- Dominated by giant component  
- Undefined for disconnected graphs without modification  

---

### 3.2 Modularity and Community Detection

#### Modularity

\[
Q = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{ij} \left[A_{ij} - \frac{k_i k_j}{2m}\right] \delta(c_i, c_j)
\]

**Interpretation**

Difference between observed and random-graph expectation.

**Key Properties**

- Resolution limit  
- Many near-optimal solutions  
- NP-hard optimization  

**Implication**

Communities are **hypotheses**, not ground truth.

**Power Atlas**

- Store:
  - Algorithm name  
  - Parameters  
  - Random seed  
  - Timestamp  

---

### 3.3 Weighted Projection from Bipartite Graphs

#### Raw Projection

\[
A = B B^T
\]

\[
A_{pq} = \sum_i B_{pi} B_{qi}
\]

Counts shared institutions.

---

#### Weighting Options

- Binary thresholding  
- Duration overlap:

\[
A_{pq} = \sum_i \min(d_{pi}, d_{qi})
\]

- Time decay:

\[
w = e^{-\lambda \Delta t}
\]

---

#### Biases

- High-degree institutions dominate  
- Artificial cliques  

---

#### Mitigations

- Degree-normalized weights  
- Statistical significance filtering  
- Retain bipartite form whenever possible  

---

### 3.4 Brokerage and Bridging

#### Weak Ties (Granovetter)

Edges with low interaction strength often bridge clusters.

---

#### Betweenness as Proxy

Imperfect proxy for brokerage.

---

#### Structural Holes (Conceptual)

Nodes connecting otherwise disconnected groups experience reduced redundancy.

---

#### Cross-Layer Brokerage

Brokerage across edge types or layers may differ from single-layer analysis.

---

#### Instability Sources

- Time window selection  
- Weighting scheme  
- Missing data  

---

#### Key Clarification

Brokerage ≠ influence  
Brokerage ≠ intent  
Brokerage ≠ control  

---

## 4. Modeling Conventions for Power Atlas

### Node Identity

- Stable internal ID  
- Canonical name  
- Alias table  

### Edge Typing

- Each edge has type:
  - membership  
  - transaction  
  - communication  
  - citation  

### Temporal Scoping

Edges must include:

- start_time  
- end_time (nullable)  

### Provenance

Each edge must record:

- Source  
- Extraction method  
- Confidence  

---

## 5. Known Failure Modes and Epistemic Limits

- Missing data bias  
- Survivorship bias  
- Boundary specification problem  
- Parameter dependence  
- Projection artifacts  
- Overinterpretation of centrality  

No single metric encodes “importance.”

---

## 6. Architectural Implications

- Separate raw observations from derived graphs  
- All metrics stored as parameterized artifacts  
- Recomputable pipelines  
- Versioned models  
- Auditable provenance  

---

## 7. Glossary of Core Terms

- **Node**: entity in graph  
- **Edge**: relation  
- **Degree**: number of connections  
- **Path**: sequence of edges  
- **Component**: connected subgraph  
- **Projection**: one-mode reduction of bipartite graph  
- **Modularity**: community quality function  
- **Centrality**: numeric node descriptor
