I found this information on the web. I would like to fact check it and weigh it's accuracy for components that are veritable, I would like to explore how this information fits in a larger context. To help analyze the data I will be using ACE Knowledge Graph. Our goal now, is to create the input for ACE. We will use the names contained in this document and the context as seeds, and then search the web and generate the best knowledge graph data input we can. Here is the content:

to understand the current situation with TPUSA, you have to know that Evangelicalism and Zionism were formed hand in hand, and that Evangelicalism is a 100yr old military psyop. He responded with "thanks" and that was it. Your podcast reminded me that there is a hidden British connection to all this. The Scholfield bible printed by Oxford Press.....twice, British Palestine, the Balfour Declaration, Pergamon Press (Robert Maxwell) and more recently, Cambridge Analytica, Parler and the SCL Group. 


I'm realizing that both Charlie and Candace were targeted by the international surveillance state as up and coming political stars. Erika has her obvious connections to military tech through both her parents, but no one seems to talk about George Farmer. Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of Candace, so I share this out of worry, not for smears. A quick google search led me down a long rabbit hole in which were similarly linked tech/surveillance connections that we see with Erika. The story we are told is that George is a Catholic and Candace converted for him, which might be true, but he didn't grow up Catholic. His dad, Micheal Farmer https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Farmer,_Baron_Farmer is a prominent Evangelical businessman, who made his money in the London Metal Exchange and is the Chairman of the Counsel of Christians and Jews (of which King Charles is a patron), and is involved with a school for disadvantaged children in South London. Sounds familiar? As for George https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Farmer_(businessman), he was the Chairman of Turning Point UK (Zio org) and the CEO of Parler. Parler, was mostly responsible for spreading the Qanon psyop (clearly planted to discredit real victims), and the Jan 6 organizing (along with TPUSA) that proved to be a trap set by the feds. Lets not forget, a major funder of Parler was Dan Bongino, who proved to be a fed through and through. One of the founders of Parler was Rebekah Mercer https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebekah_Mercer . She has ties to Steve Bannon, the Heritage Foundation and Breitbart News. Her father, Robert Mercer https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mercer has his tentacles all over tech and surveillance, including Cambridge Analytica (the resulting data scandal caused a mass migration from Meta based platforms to Parler and Twitter).
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica and Renaissance Technologies LLC https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Technologies, one of the largest contributors to US federal campaigns. Cambridge Analytica's parent company was the SCL Group https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCL_Group, a data mining company started as Behavioral Dynamics Institute (study of mass behavior in many countries), formally directed by Lord Ivar Mountbatten (cousin of the royals, son of Lord Mounbatten who famously abused boys and took Prince Andrew to a whore house when he was 11). Nigel Oaks https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Oakes , the founder and CEO of SCL Group has an interesting entry in the "career" section of his wikipedia page. Quote: "Cambridge Analytica claimed to use honey traps and bribery stings, and prostitutes, among other tactics, to influence more than 200 elections globally for its clients."
