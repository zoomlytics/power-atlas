# Track G — Internal Design Spike / Thought Experiment (internal-spike) — v0.1

**Track slug:** internal-spike  
**Applies to:** internal conceptual stress tests; not primarily about external sources  
**Primary purpose:** surface semantic pressure points early (time collapse, contradiction, identity drift, ranking harms).  
**Default depth level:** Level 1–2 (crisp outputs)

---

## 1) When to use this track
Use when:
- you need to answer “what if we…” questions safely and quickly
- you suspect boundary ambiguity in ontology/provenance/metrics/governance
Avoid when:
- the goal is to learn an external method/tech deeply (use other tracks)

## 2) Required inputs (minimum)
- [ ] A clearly stated scenario (conceptual narrative)
- [ ] Links to relevant v0.1 boundary docs being stressed

## 3) Required outputs (minimum)
- Level 1:
  - [ ] Notes (scenario + pressure points)
  - [ ] Brief summary (optional)
- Level 2 if it finds meaningful pressure points:
  - [ ] Research memo OR a formal simulation under `/docs/ontology/simulations/`

## 4) Track-specific evaluation checklist
- [ ] Which invariants/charters are touched?
- [ ] What breaks or becomes ambiguous?
- [ ] What is the minimal guardrail language needed?
- [ ] What is the “replaceability test” result (would UI/storage change meaning)?
- [ ] Does it introduce escalation or authority laundering risk?

## 5) Stop rules
Stop when:
- you can state: scenario → invariants stressed → pressure points → proposed resolution options
Escalate if:
- it implies changes to boundary docs or governance posture

## 6) Integration targets
- Ontology simulations framework/examples
- Updates/patch proposals to v0.1 docs (conceptual wording)

## 7) Common pitfalls
- Turning spikes into feature proposals (keep conceptual)
- Skipping explicit mapping to invariants

## 8) Suggested tags
- `simulation`, `stress-test`, `invariants`, `guardrails`, `internal`
