> Paste this at the top of a Notes document (recommended), or adapt as needed.  
> Purpose: make scope/intent explicit, keep timeboxes honest, and improve auditability—especially when using AI tools.

**Track (primary):** `[conceptual-research | methods-techniques | tech-evaluation | data-source | case-study | similar-platforms | internal-spike | misc]`  
**Track (secondary, optional):** `[]`

**Study question (1–2 sentences):**  
- 

**Why now / decision support:**  
- What project uncertainty does this reduce?
