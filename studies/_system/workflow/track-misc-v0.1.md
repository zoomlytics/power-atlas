Use when:
- you cannot confidently pick a primary track after the decision tree
Avoid when:
- a primary track is reasonably clear (prefer choosing one)

- [ ] State why it doesn’t fit existing tracks
- [ ] State intended resolution: reclassify or split plan

## 3) Required outputs (minimum)
- [ ] Notes
- [ ] Brief summary (recommended)

## 4) Track-specific evaluation checklist
- [ ] What is the intended final primary track?
- [ ] Should this be split into multiple studies? If yes, propose filenames/slugs.
- [ ] What is the minimal “useful payload” to preserve?

## 5) Stop rules

- you have enough to reclassify or split

## 6) Integration targets
- Reclassify to A–G within a week/timebox, if possible

## 7) Common pitfalls
- Misc becoming the default
