# Power Atlas — Provenance & Confidence Model Charter (v0.1, Draft)

**Status:** Experimental  
**Audience:** Contributors, architects, reviewers  
**Scope:** Semantic Core boundary protection (provenance, evidence, confidence, and epistemic integrity)

---

## 1) Purpose

This charter defines the conceptual meaning of **provenance** and **confidence** in Power Atlas, and establishes the semantic commitments required to preserve **auditability**, **neutrality**, and **epistemic integrity** as the system evolves.

This document is part of the Semantic Core boundary declared in:

- Architecture Overview v0.1: [`/docs/architecture/v0.1.md`](/docs/architecture/v0.1.md)
- Ontology Charter v0.1: [`/docs/ontology/v0.1.md`](/docs/ontology/v0.1.md)

It specifies **what provenance and confidence mean** in Power Atlas, what minimum conceptual requirements apply to claims, and what the system must be able to explain over time.

This document is **not** a schema, database model, API contract, scoring algorithm, UI specification, or operational policy.

---

## 2) Design Principles (v0.1)

1. **Semantic independence**
   - Provenance and confidence semantics must remain valid regardless of storage engine, serialization, query strategy, API shape, or UI presentation.

2. **Evidence-first, attribution-required**
   - Claims must be attributable and traceable to sources and/or derivation processes.
   - The system must preserve the distinction between "supported by evidence" and "asserted without evidence."

3. **Separation of structure vs epistemics**
   - Structural modeling (entities, relationships) is distinct from epistemic qualification (what is claimed, by whom/what, based on what, and with what uncertainty).

4. **Transparency over authority**
   - The system should not ask users to trust it; it should enable users to inspect **why** an assertion exists and **what supports it**.

5. **Uncertainty is first-class**
   - Ambiguity, dispute, and incomplete information must be representable without forcing false precision.

6. **Time-aware traceability**
   - Provenance and confidence must support temporal reasoning: what was believed/claimed when, what changed, and why.

7. **Non-escalation and neutrality**
   - Provenance and confidence must not be used to smuggle interpretive conclusions (intent, motive, wrongdoing, moral judgment) into the Semantic Core.

8. **Auditability and contestability**
   - The system must support review, challenge, and revision without erasing history or collapsing disagreements into a single "truth."

## 3) Conceptual Definitions (v0.1)

This section defines terms at the conceptual level. These are meaning commitments, not implementation requirements.

### 3.1 Evidence
**Evidence** is a source artifact or observation that supports, contextualizes, or disputes a claim.

Evidence may include (conceptually):
- documents, records, datasets, transcripts, media, or measurements,
- human observations or annotations,
- outputs of extraction or analysis processes (as artifacts).

**Key constraint:** Evidence is not synonymous with "truth." Evidence can be incomplete, misleading, forged, contested, or irrelevant; its role is to be **referenceable and attributable**, not automatically authoritative.

### 3.2 Source (Origin)
A **source** is the origin context from which evidence is obtained or to which evidence is attributable.

A source is conceptual and may be:
- a publication context (issuer, author, publisher),
- a dataset origin (curator, release),
- a human contributor,
- a system or instrument that produced an artifact.

**Key constraint:** "Source" answers *where this came from* (origin), not *how we processed it* (derivation).

### 3.3 Provenance
**Provenance** is the attribution and traceability context required to answer:

- **Origin:** Where did this evidence/claim come from?
- **Responsibility:** Who or what asserted/produced it?
- **Derivation:** How was it generated, transformed, extracted, or inferred?
- **Timing:** When was it observed, asserted, ingested, or revised?
- **Lineage:** What inputs and prior states does it depend on?

In v0.1, provenance is treated as a **semantic requirement for claims**, not an optional annotation.

### 3.4 Claim (Epistemic unit)
A **claim** is an attributed assertion that some structural statement holds (e.g., a relationship instance) under stated conditions and context.

A claim is the epistemic unit that should carry (conceptually):
- references to relevant evidence (where applicable),
- provenance context (origin and/or derivation),
- temporal qualification (as-of or interval, when relevant),
- confidence expression (what kind of uncertainty or status applies).

**Key constraint:** Power Atlas may represent structure, but structure is not automatically an endorsed assertion. Endorsement is claim-mediated.

### 3.5 Derivation Process
A **derivation process** is any transformation that produces a new assertion or artifact from prior artifacts, including:
- extraction,
- normalization,
- aggregation,
- linking/resolution,
- summarization,
- inference.

**Key constraint:** Derived outputs must remain attributable to their inputs and process context. "Derived" does not mean "true," only "produced by a process."

### 3.6 Confidence (Epistemic qualifier)
**Confidence** is a semantic qualifier describing the epistemic status of a claim: how it should be interpreted given evidence, provenance, derivation context, and dispute.

Confidence is not:
- a popularity score,
- a moral judgment,
- a narrative conclusion,
- a substitute for provenance.

Confidence can be expressed categorically in v0.1 (conceptual categories), without requiring numeric scoring.

### 3.7 Confidence Categories (v0.1)
The following categories describe permissible epistemic statuses. They are conceptual, not UI labels.

- **Verified**: The claim is supported by evidence considered strong under stated criteria (criteria are not fixed here, but must be explainable via provenance/evidence).
- **Alleged**: The claim is attributed to a source or agent, but evidence may be limited, indirect, contested, or not independently validated.
- **Inferred**: The claim is produced by a derivation process from other claims/evidence; the derivation path must be traceable.
- **Disputed**: The claim is contested by counterevidence, competing claims, or credible disagreement; the dispute context must be representable.
- **Unknown / Unassessed**: The claim exists but has not been assigned a confidence status, or the system lacks sufficient context to do so.

**Key constraint:** Confidence categories express *epistemic stance*, not *final truth*.

---

## 4) Minimum Conceptual Requirements (v0.1)

These are the minimum semantic expectations for any claim represented in Power Atlas.

### 4.1 What must be attributable?
At minimum, a claim must be attributable to:
- a **source origin** (e.g., a document/dataset/human/system origin), and/or
- a **derivation process** (e.g., an extraction/inference workflow), and
- an **asserting agent** (human or system process) where meaningful.

The system must be able to distinguish:
- **source-originated claims** (attributed to an external source), vs
- **system-derived claims** (attributed to internal derivation), vs
- **human-authored claims** (attributed to a contributor/reviewer).

### 4.2 Minimum conceptual metadata for a claim
Without specifying fields, the claim must be able to carry:

- **Attribution:** who/what is responsible for the assertion (source and/or agent)
- **Evidence linkage:** references to evidence (or explicit marking that evidence is absent or unknown)
- **Temporal context:** when the claim is asserted to hold, and/or when it was observed/recorded
- **Derivation traceability:** if derived, the claim must be linked to its inputs and process context
- **Confidence expression:** an epistemic status that can be revised over time
- **Revision trace:** the claim must support tracking changes to confidence and attribution context over time

### 4.3 Source origin vs derivation process
Power Atlas must preserve a clear separation:

- **Source origin** answers: *What external origin is this attributable to?*
- **Derivation process** answers: *What transformations produced this from prior artifacts?*

Both may apply simultaneously (e.g., a sourced document that is extracted by a system process, then reviewed by a human).

## 5) Modeling Boundaries (What This Charter Does and Does Not Mean)

### 5.1 What provenance does NOT mean
- Provenance is not a guarantee of truth.
- Provenance is not a reputation score or authority ranking.
- Provenance is not a substitute for evidence.
- Provenance is not an endorsement of the claim by Power Atlas.

### 5.2 What confidence does NOT imply
- Confidence does not imply moral, legal, or ethical judgment.
- Confidence is not a declaration of intent, motive, or wrongdoing.
- Confidence is not a performance metric of a person or organization.
- Confidence is not required to be numeric in v0.1, and numeric representation (if ever used) must not collapse nuance or dispute.

### 5.3 What the system must not assert
Within the Semantic Core, the system must not:
- encode narrative interpretations as "confidence,"
- elevate structural connectivity into implied culpability,
- equate association with intent or wrongdoing,
- treat derived inference as equivalent to sourced evidence without explicit labeling and traceability.

---

## 6) Interplay Model (Evidence ↔ Claim ↔ Source ↔ Derivation ↔ Review ↔ Time)

This section describes conceptual interactions without imposing a workflow.

### 6.1 Evidence and claim
- Evidence provides support or context for claims.
- A claim may reference multiple pieces of evidence.
- Evidence may support, weaken, or contradict a claim.

### 6.2 Source and claim
- A claim must be attributable to a source and/or an asserting agent/process.
- Multiple sources may assert similar or conflicting claims; the system must permit coexistence when properly attributed.

### 6.3 Derivation and claim
- Derived claims must remain explicitly distinguishable from source-originated claims.
- Derived claims must be traceable to inputs and derivation context.
- Derived claims should remain contestable and revisable when inputs change or new evidence arrives.

### 6.4 Human review
- Human review is a provenance-relevant event: it changes epistemic status, not necessarily structure.
- The Semantic Core must allow representing that a claim has been reviewed, challenged, or annotated, without requiring a specific review workflow.

### 6.5 Temporal revision
- Claims exist in time: they may be added, revised, superseded, retracted, or disputed.
- The system should support reasoning such as:
  - "This claim was alleged as-of date X"
  - "Confidence increased after review on date Y"
  - "This claim was superseded by later evidence"
  - "Two competing claims coexisted during interval Z"

**Key constraint:** Revision should not erase prior states; it should preserve auditability.

## 7) Non-Goals (v0.1)

This charter does **not** define:

- any database schema, table/graph structures, or serialization format,
- any API routes, payloads, or authentication model,
- any UI components, visualization conventions, or labeling requirements,
- any automated confidence scoring algorithm or weighting engine,
- any fixed policy for what qualifies as "strong evidence" across all domains,
- any exhaustive taxonomy of edge cases (domain-specific disputes, legal standards, etc.),
- any governance or moderation policy (beyond conceptual constraints).

---

## 8) Versioning & Upgradability

- This document is **Provenance & Confidence Model Charter v0.1** and is a baseline semantic commitment.
- Future versions (v0.2+) may refine:
  - confidence categories,
  - provenance depth expectations by claim class,
  - representation of dispute and counterevidence,
  - representational detail for derivation traceability.

**Upgrade constraint:** Changes must be explicit and backward-reasoned. Upgrades must not force redefinition of what provenance or confidence *means* due to infrastructure choices.

A useful upgrade test:
> "If we replaced storage, API, and UI tomorrow, would our provenance and confidence semantics remain intact and auditable?"

---

## 9) Acceptance Criteria (v0.1)

This draft is considered acceptable for v0.1 when it:

- establishes conceptual definitions for evidence, provenance, source origin, derivation, claim, and confidence,
- states minimum conceptual requirements for claim attribution and traceability,
- provides confidence categories that distinguish verified/alleged/inferred/disputed/unknown without implying numeric scoring,
- preserves neutrality and structural focus (no intent, motive, wrongdoing encoding),
- is implementation-agnostic (no schema/API/UI/storage references),
- is versioned and includes explicit non-goals and upgrade guidance,
- remains consistent with:
  - Architecture Overview v0.1 (`/docs/architecture/v0.1.md`)
  - Ontology Charter v0.1 (`/docs/ontology/v0.1.md`)
  - Semantic Invariants v0.1 (`/docs/ontology/validation/semantic-invariants-v0.1.md`)

## Closing Note (Draft Status)

This v0.1 charter is a boundary document for the experimental phase. Its purpose is to preserve epistemic integrity while enabling aggressive iteration in implementation. It is intentionally restrained: it defines meaning commitments and auditability requirements without prescribing how they are built.
