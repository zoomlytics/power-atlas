# Ontology Charter — v0.2 Direction Proposal (Draft)

**Status:** Directional (not part of v0.1 baseline)

This note captures a forward-looking refinement direction derived from the v0.1 charter. It is conceptual and implementation-agnostic.

## Claim vs Relationship Clarification

- **Relationship** remains a structural connection type/category.
- **Claim** remains the epistemic unit asserting that a specific relationship instance holds between specific entities under time, provenance, evidence, and confidence context.

## Conceptual Layering Direction

- **Structural layer**: entities, relationship types.
- **Epistemic layer**: claims, evidence, provenance, temporal qualification, confidence.

## Candidate Invariant for v0.2

- **Relationship existence is claim-mediated** — no structural connection is treated as semantically asserted without claim context.

This direction does not mandate graph-edge reification, table design, or API structure.
