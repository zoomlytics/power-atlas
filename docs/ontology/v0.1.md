# Power Atlas — Ontology Charter (v0.1, Draft)

**Status:** Experimental  
**Audience:** Contributors, architects, reviewers  
**Scope:** Semantic Core boundary protection

## 1) Purpose

This charter defines what ontology means in Power Atlas and protects the **Semantic Core vs Implementation Layer** boundary introduced in [`/docs/architecture/v0.1.md`](/docs/architecture/v0.1.md).

It states:

- what constitutes core semantic constructs,
- what ontology can and cannot define in v0.1,
- and how semantics stay durable as infrastructure evolves.

This document is not a schema, database model, API contract, or finalized vocabulary.

## 2) Ontology Principles (v0.1)

1. **Semantic independence** — Definitions must not depend on storage engines, APIs, query languages, or UI constraints.
2. **Evidence alignment** — Structural assertions must be supportable by evidence or explicitly marked as hypotheses.
3. **Attribution and provenance** — Assertions must be attributable to source origin and derivation path.
4. **Temporal awareness** — Claims and structural assertions must be time-capable.
5. **Confidence as first-class** — Uncertainty must be represented explicitly.
6. **Structural neutrality** — Ontology models structure, not motive, intent, or wrongdoing.
7. **Versioned evolvability** — Semantic primitives should evolve through explicit versions without semantic rupture.
8. **Replaceability** — Infrastructure can change without redefining semantic meaning.

## 3) Core Semantic Constructs

These constructs define conceptual meaning (not storage representation):

- **Entity**: A distinguishable participant in structural modeling.
- **Relationship**: A structural connection category between entities.
- **Claim**: An assertion that a relationship instance holds under stated conditions.
- **Evidence**: A source artifact supporting or contextualizing a claim.
- **Provenance**: Attribution describing source origin and derivation.
- **Temporal qualification**: Time-scoped applicability of a claim.
- **Confidence expression**: Explicit uncertainty or reliability attached to a claim.

Graph-language terms are implementation-level only:

- **Node (implementation term)**: A possible storage/graph representation of a semantic construct.
- **Edge (implementation term)**: A possible storage/graph representation of a relationship assertion.

Node/edge choices must not redefine ontology-level meaning.

## 4) Modeling Boundaries for v0.1

### Permissible (in scope)

- Defining conceptual primitives and their semantic intent.
- Requiring evidence/provenance/temporal/confidence capability.
- Allowing conflicting claims to coexist when attributed and time-qualified.
- Defining conceptual invariants that are testable independent of infrastructure.

### Impermissible (out of scope)

- Encoding motive, legal judgment, or narrative interpretation as ontology primitives.
- Treating derived analytics (centrality, projections, summaries, visual layouts) as primitives.
- Binding semantic definitions to graph edges, tables, API payloads, or UI views.
- Finalizing future-version vocabulary in v0.1.

## 5) Non-Goals (v0.1)

This charter does not define:

- node labels or edge types,
- field-level schema mappings,
- database tables,
- API contracts,
- query language syntax,
- tool/technology restrictions,
- finalized terms for future versions.

## 6) Versioning and Upgradability

- This document is **Ontology Charter v0.1** and should be treated as a versioned semantic baseline.
- Future versions (e.g., v0.2+) may refine terms and invariants, but changes should be explicit and backward-reasoned.
- Upgrades should preserve semantic continuity and avoid infrastructure-driven redefinition of primitives.
